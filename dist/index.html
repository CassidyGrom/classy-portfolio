                            <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">When I read that thousands of out-of-work New Jersyans were stuck in the unemployment system, unable to receive their benefits due to technical glitches and infrastructure meltdowns, I knew there had to be a better way to tell the story.

                                        My eyes sometimes skip over large numbers, and I knew our readers' eyes tend to do the same. When I wanted to cover the rising scale of unemployment in New Jersey, I set out to design an experience that would humanize the people affected, where readers could put faces and names to the growing figures. <br><br>

                                        I mocked up a few wireframes, showing my ideal end-product. My editor immediately agreed to the pitch. I researched the issue and designed a simple Google form to compile individual  experiences with the unemployment system. I partnered with reporters who were already covering the labor beat, and we refined the form to be conversational and formatted the responses for consistency. I suggested translating the form into Spanish, which is the second-most-spoken language in N.J., and worked closely with the translator to get our wording right. This was the first major project our newsroom produced in two languages; it set a precedent, and we now do this more often. <br><br>

                                        When the form was ready to go, reporters seeded it into local Facebook groups. As responses started rolling in, I formatted our database to make the responses easier to work with (using auto-fill, color-coding, adding tabs, etc). We received almost 1,000 responses. Reporters mined the database, selecting 20 people to further interview. Meanwhile, I coached the photographers on the style of photos I needed for the format: vertical to optimize the mobile experience, outdoors for social distancing, and the subjects in a door frame for visual consistency.<br><br>

                                        I read through every response, selecting an additional 100 people to feature in the thumbnail galleries. My team wrote a javascript command to automatically send a photo request to each person selected. I knew that these people were under a lot of stress, so I tried to make even the automated interactions warm and personable. <br><br>
                                        I trained a reporter on how to vet, save, and name the photos we received; then we began coding. We used a mix of ArchieML and Handlebars to scrape the spreadsheet and populate the thumbnail galleries. Even this amount of automation was a lifesaver. The front end was a typical mix of Javascript, HTML and CSS, with a little bit of D3 for the Spanish language toggler at the top. My colleague wrote the backend code according to my requests, and I selected the layout, colors, and fonts. The reporters chose their favorite quotes from the people they interviewed in person, and I processed and chose the larger photos to accompany it.
                                        In the title section, I wanted to show how one person’s struggle affects everyone around them. I achieved this by flipping between two photos of each interviewee: one alone and another with their families. <br><br>
                                        When we published the final story, we wrote another script to notify everyone involved. Dozens of participants thanked us for listening to them when no one else would. We got word that Governor Phil Murphy called a meeting the next day to address the systemic problem and provided immediate help for the residents we featured. The reporters on our team tell me they still use the database we built for follow up stories and to stay in contact with some of the participants.<br><br>

                                                I read on Twitter one day that fewer than 1% of American nuns are under the age of 40. This dilemma made me curious. How does someone become a nun anyway? I decided to find out more. <br><br>

                                                I watched a documentary about "nun runs," where young women travel across the U.S. and tour convents like high school kids visiting colleges. A few years later, our newsroom was hosting a creative pitching session, and I threw out the idea that we could join a nun run. The editors were intrigued, so I tracked down a handful of young nuns in New Jersey and interviewed them. <br><br>

                                                Unlike interviews for news stories, these conversations were long and winding. I wasn't looking for a specific angle. I just hung out with the nuns at their convents or monasteries to find out more about their lives. I built common ground with them and slowly gained their trust. <br><br>

                                                I returned to the newsroom with a few motifs in mind. I was assigned a co-writer, Amanda, to help cover more ground and give the story another perspective. We were two young women interviewing other young women and I think some of that natural dialogue comes through in the story. We wrote several drafts before landing on the final version, and I asked if I could personally design the article. <br><br>

                                                I knew what image I wanted for the cover and I worked closely with photographer Patti until we landed on the perfect shot. I did this project before I knew how to code, so I googled a few CSS tricks and made the graphic assets in Illustrator. I went through a few dozen design options before deciding on the branding and flow of the story. This project taught me how to ask the right questions about stakeholders' goals and how to iterate and refine a design concept. <br><br>

                                                The story was well-received by our audience. WNYC invited Amanda and me to speak on air about the reporting process. The society for features journalism awarded the article second place in its diversity in the digital features category.  It also landed me a spot at the Michael Cromartie Faith Angle Forum in Washington D.C. <br><br>

                                                I stay connected with some of the nuns. Recently, <a href="https://www.nj.com/opinion/2020/03/im-a-nun-and-ive-been-social-distancing-for-29-years-here-are-tips-for-staying-home-amid-coronavirus-fears.html" target="_blamk">I asked one for her advice on social distancing </a>, and I've considered one day writing a book about their lives. <br><br>
